\section{Particle Signatures in IceCube}

The characteristic signature left by a particle in the IceCube detector depends on its type, the type of interaction and the energy. Given the spacial resolution of the detector array, individual particles that are produced by these interactions cannot be resolved individually, with the exception of the muon. Instead, signatures of hadronic and electromagnetic cascades (see sections~\ref{sec:had-showers} and \ref{sec:em-showers}) are summarised as \emph{cascades}, while the elongated signature of a muon travelling through the detector (see section~\ref{sec:muon-propagation}) is called a \emph{track}.
