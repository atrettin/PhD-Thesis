\section{Particle Signatures in IceCube}

The characteristic signature left by a particle in the IceCube detector depends on its type, the type of interaction and the energy. Given the spacial resolution of the detector array, individual particles that are produced by these interactions cannot be resolved individually, with the exception of the muon. Instead, signatures in IceCube can be approximated as combinations of compact shower-like \emph{cascades} and elongated \emph{tracks}, the latter of which is only produced by muons.
