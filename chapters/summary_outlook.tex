\chapter{Summary and Future Outlook}

This work presented two oscillation measurements of atmospheric neutrinos using the DeepCore sub-array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Both measurements were based on a newly developed data sample of \num{21914} well-reconstructed, track-like events

This chapter summarizes the the results obtained in \cref{ch:measurement-three-flavor, ch:measurement-sterile} and discusses the future outlook for sterile neutrino searches with the DeepCore detector.

\subsection{Three-Flavor Oscillations}
\label{sec:summary-three-flavor}

The three-flavor oscillation measurement presented in \refch{measurement-three-flavor} was based on a newly devloped data sample of \num{21914} well-reconstructed, track-like events.
