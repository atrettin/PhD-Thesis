The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a gigaton-scale Cherenkov detector located at the geographic South Pole in close proximity to the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.
Constructed over the course of several deployment seasons between 2006 and 2011, it instruments approximately one cubic-kilometer of Antarctic glacier with optical sensors that can detect faint flashes of light that are produced when charged particles travel through the ice, such as those produced by neutrino interactions.
The detector serves as both a telescope to study the astrophysical origin of neutrinos and an instrument to measure their fundamental properties.

This chapter describes the instrumentation and layout of the IceCube detector, the interactions that particles undergo when they interact with the ice, and finally the signals that these interactions produce in the detector.
